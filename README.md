# ExoClouds.jl

This package contains Julia implementations of several models for clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres, to express different models in a common physics framework as a test case for stratified modelling of physical phenomena as a usable method in research.

Currently, this includes a port of the [virga](https://github.com/natashabatalha/virga) Python package, and [CARMA](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CARMA).
