# ExoClouds.jl

This package contains Julia implementations of several models for clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres, to enable direct comparative studies of different methods to assess their accuracy and computational requirements.

Currently, this includes a port of the [virga](https://github.com/natashabatalha/virga) Python package, and will (possibly) soon include [CARMA](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CARMA).
